-----------
An Android app that let's you browse the "Gone with the Blastwave"-Comic on your phone!
<br/>

Screenshots
-----------

The yellows stole all the screenshots. 


Installation
------------
Download and build this app. There is currently no release. That is because the blue's stole all of them!


Developing
------------

You should first make sure you have cloned this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/newhinton/gone-app
```

Before you can build the actual app, you need to provide the comic-data:
```sh
bash ./scripts/getComicData.sh
```
This embeds all the comics in the artifact. Bash required.


You can then build the app normally from Android Studio or from CLI by running:

```sh
# build
./gradlew assemble

```


Contributing
------------

Anyone is welcome to contribute and help out. However, hate, discrimination and racism are decidedly unwelcome here. If you feel offended by this, you might belong to the group of people who are not welcome. I will not tolerate hate in any way.


Donations
------------

If you like my work, either this app or in general, you are more than welcome to leave a donation.
It helps me to dedicate time to further improve my apps!
